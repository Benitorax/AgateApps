        Shadows of Esteren is a project created by Agate studio. This horrific and gothic medieval universe,
        inspired by Celtic legends, is divided into several supports: tabletop role-playing game, board game,
        video game and music.
        <br>

        pionneer in the crossmedia world, Esteren is the first french project to have won
        a dozen of prizes in the USA including four Ennie Awards in 2013 and 2016.
