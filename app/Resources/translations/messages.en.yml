        Shadows of Esteren is the work of Studio Agate. It exists through various media: a tabletop role-play game,
        music, board games, and even video games.
        <br><br>
        The first book of this series was published in France in 2010, then in the USA in 2012. An innovating
        project with thriving transmedia content, Shadows of Esteren is the first French creation to have earned a
        dozen awards in the USA, including four Ennie Awards in 2013 and 2016.
