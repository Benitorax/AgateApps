        Shadows of Esteren is the work of Studio Agate. It exists through various media: a tabletop role-play game,
        music, board games, and even video games.
        <br><br>
        Innovative and crossmedia project, Shadows of Esteren is the first French creation of its kind to have obtained
        a dozen of prices internationally, including four Ennie Awards at Indianapolis GenCon in 2013 and 2016.
